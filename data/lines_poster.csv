89,"here and there and we jam on the piano.","",1
89,"You're also a love scene","",1
89,"played it all the time and then there were also you know in the","",1
89,"church my grandmother's son. Being","",1
89,"too about this thing. My grandmother was a Catholic so","",1
89,"raised so we had it all over you know seeing","",1
89,"him both a different spin on different kinds of music","",1
89,"who was doing them and all that kind of stuff so it was","",1
89,".","",1
89,"The same music and music. My parents private that's","",1
89,". OK That's cute. To.","",1
89,"Hear. This kind of music","",1
89,"you know.","",1
89,"Yes very little but I was telling people that I am really","",1
89,"soul singer. Who loves to do standards you know. But I looked","",1
89,"at the result of us it is because there are so many really really","",1
89,"beautiful scenes out here. You work.","",1
89,"That I have knowledge history","",1
89,"of the jazz technical stuff the theory and I don't have that","",1
89,"stuff but the Iranian state","",1
89,"so therefore Sam always still more but I do sing jazz","",1
89,"with a twist and so on.","",1
89,"So everybody can relate to it.","",1
89,"Is there any","",1
89,"chance I'm sure it's well I don't","",1
89,"know but by our rules I mean it covers such a wide range.","",1
89,"James Brown Sly Stone King Cole Ray","",1
89,"Charles Lou Rawls. Elephants just survive it because they're all different","",1
89,"styles. So I do whatever that style is you","",1
89,"know that's what I meant today.","",1
89,"OK.","",1
89,"And before I do perform publicly and","",1
89,"I have I have a website which is W","",1
89,"W W that Frank Sr That","",1
89,"com F R A N K S E N O R.","",1
89,"That and you got that. Yeah and if","",1
89,"you go there you know if anyone is listening","",1
89,"go to the site and you can always follow my calendar as to where","",1
89,"and I do have a CD burner in the studio right now working on","",1
89,"my second CD.","",1
89,"Then you know really the problem here but I have","",1
89,"somebody that's created this is the first","",1
89,"one was let me be frank.","",1
89,"Then it was changed to listening in the dark so when you hear it good","",1
89,"either way I'm interested to","",1
89,"know where","",1
89,"the other members of your your family blind not just just","",1
89,"myself and whether it was I","",1
89,"mean you say I was premature.","",1
89,"So it wasn't anything that was hereditary. It was too much oxygen","",1
89,"destroyed the optic nerve circles because being an incubator","",1
89,"too much oxygen so so that is how I want to","",1
89,"live but I was one pound twelve up twelve ounces here so you know","",1
89,"I was still people around here you know I didn't know you're here you know","",1
89,"I do know you so I was one pound twelve ounces and","",1
89,".","",1
89,"You know a lot of people. Just say","",1
89,"it was lose oxygen shows bring it a little bit but","",1
89,"you know and maybe when I'm here.","",1
89,"Yeah have you","",1
89,"know ballers it been blind I mean really to me","",1
89,"and this is this is I just think how","",1
89,"my parents did it but you know I was chosen to be blind","",1
89,"from the chosen one to be lived and I'm going to represent it the way that it is and what","",1
89,"it is is a way of life you know it's just that that's just how i","",1
89,"live from LA and I'm proud of who I am","",1
89,"and I use the blindness to my benefit. You know what","",1
89,"was given back to me is an era listen and an open heart","",1
89,"to you know let everything people it's about trust","",1
89,"and then to have the gift of music to give it is is","",1
89,"the trade off. So you know I had to","",1
89,"wear a low where well you know it's","",1
89,"it's not as I work for dialogue in the dark","",1
89,"which is which was here for two years. It's one hundred","",1
89,"twenty nine cities all over the world in the forty countries and what it","",1
89,"is is taking sighted people through. They","",1
89,"cower like we had six six","",1
89,"room gallery and they were all","",1
89,"like Central Park supermarket with subway","",1
89,". We have Times Square in there but you went through in total","",1
89,"darkness you couldn't see you can't even see no","",1
89,"shades Nothing says total darkness and the","",1
89,"people that are taking you through were blind or visually impaired","",1
89,". So when you go through their email you of course you know","",1
89,"you don't get a sense of of what it is to be","",1
89,"blind but you do get a sense of how black people are treated","",1
89,"because now that you're in there you you are really","",1
89,".","",1
89,"You're so wild and it's amazing and it gives this the blind person","",1
89,"who'll we have about fifteen and really an opportunity to","",1
89,"lead in their own environment and see the difference because not","",1
89,"worse. Over all over the place the gallery spaces","",1
89,"you stand for much. Still trying to take it one step at a time because you're free to do","",1
89,"it but then use as you as you get comfortable with then you start","",1
89,"relaxing and what I'm trying to do is get you to","",1
89,"understand forget us because after a while you know realize you can't use in the trite","",1
89,"and can't and there's just really hone in on the other senses.","",1
89,"It's called Dialogue in the dark and it's","",1
89,"it started in Germany and the biggest one right now is in Israel. Really we want","",1
89,"to know that we really do want it back. So again if anyone's listening","",1
89,"we really want to speculate is a tremendous tool to teach people","",1
89,"because once people finish going through there.","",1
89,"Their sense is wide open and bust wide open. You know there was snow and","",1
89,"everything. If we're feeling every hearing everything and then they","",1
89,"appreciated their eyesight that much more. There are forces that","",1
89,"are all told they were there because you had just because there was no","",1
89,"other choice but to use your other senses to feel your way through these guys","other choice but to use your other senses to feel your way through these guys",2
89,"you know.","you know.",2
89,"So when he came out in the end you know again appreciated the","",1
89,"power of the Web site is the beauty of what it is and","",1
89,"when she came in you came back when the lights come back on but","",1
89,"no I was it was tremendous it is your own out of the biggest one I think they get","",1
89,"because they get their public service workers cops firemen to","",1
89,"do this as a training tool. So intransitive makes a","",1
89,"much better to do. Well they know they're going to have a listen. Anyway I mean you know I'm sure they","",1
89,"have stuff now but you know you're going to recall situations where you don't have","",1
89,"the best caption dark so yes it's","",1
89,"you know and again it awakens the other senses. You know her and","",1
89,"you know different and military you know that in married there they're forced to","",1
89,"to use all of that stuff to stay alive for him.","",1
89,"Tell me something but growing up. Learning your way","",1
89,"around the. City went to school you know","",1
89,"and you know being extra inside kids you know.","",1
89,"But where did you go or school.","",1
89,"Well when I was so I started really.","",1
89,"I'm going to schools like two three years old nursery school and I was","",1
89,"in this thing called the juicier for the blind and so there I was","",1
89,"with blind people and I come home and I was in the projects with","",1
89,"far sighted people said a kid's side people say","",1
89,"kids but they were all of three four five two you know so","",1
89,"the blind thing at that time at home was","",1
89,"yes I was blind but they were so that kids were so used to","",1
89,"it so you know because we all grew up together","",1
89,"and and actually these","",1
89,"people these kids would be a part of my protection","",1
89,"because if anybody did mess with me or came in a neighborhood you know they have a back.","",1
89,"If we play baseball as we know the","",1
89,"play of course that bit a little bit and these are kids we're talking about","",1
89,"five six seven year old kids doing this on their own on their own. No I","",1
89,"don't. We just did it. They were in last","",1
89,"get. But I will always get a chance to play and I'm","",1
89,"wrestling fighting anything like that I was I was good at it.","",1
89,"So because that was physical contact and","",1
89,"they knew to fight play rough and they like that you know","",1
89,"so and I again my brother was six years old so he had his own","",1
89,"crowd but his own crowd would even look after me because that was","",1
89,"their friend's brother so so then the projects there I","",1
89,"had those people when I didn't realize that","",1
89,"until maybe I was five six years old and that I did the","",1
89,".","",1
89,"Medic school that were blind.","",1
89,"You know I got this kid with me to my house and","",1
89,". And then that was when I really learned that","",1
89,"there was different color skin. Now do you know that up until that","",1
89,"point it was one and and everyone started because","",1
89,"I mean him you know in school would always the challenge each other to","",1
89,"it because we love the box of Wheaties box we resolutely checkers because we have","",1
89,"that's how we that's how we roll with it with the best friends in there so","",1
89,"we started you know all my friends because I was I was","",1
89,"like oh by the same token I was embarrassed because.","",1
89,"Why do you say you know what did you understand. Cars","",1
89,"can you know that and I wouldn't want to you know you know my","",1
89,"attention then voices would feel people's","",1
89,"hair. For men with less isn't it","",1
89,". But you know then then I started realizing that","",1
89,"to even just a culture was different you know white","",1
89,"people did stuff different than black you know even and how it","",1
89,"played out. We talked with someone who is","",1
89,"so different I mean again","",1
89,"you know like it does seem like I. Would say to","",1
89,"white kids or. I can tell from","",1
89,"that. No because because I know I'm not going to","",1
89,"American explaining would do justice to.","",1
89,"The other side by trying to explain it but it was if it was just something","",1
89,"that you felt you know it was just something that you didn't know the","",1
89,"difference. You know and I have to say that one was wrong and one was right","",1
89,"and then I blamed him today you know and then I went to a camp six years ago","",1
89,"when all Jewish Care and. The","",1
89,"first week I got there and I cried like of the because it","",1
89,"was the first time being away I didn't know any of these kids. Plus i","",1
89,"Phone a lot really for the first time. These kids these are psyches","",1
89,"so I was out of my own you know new cabin new place I was","",1
89,"around things a lot. Only for the kids there with like you","",1
89,"know who's blind and you know I wasn't used to being treated like this I came from kids and","",1
89,"all you know so the first week or so","",1
89,"my mother sent the package of candy and stuff","",1
89,"and this one kid though it was the news that you can't because a","",1
89,"mother worked there. Jewish kid. Larry my school it's so Larry you know","",1
89,"and the guy was","",1
89,"you know he was a bully. His mother worked there and he stayed all","",1
89,"nine weeks. We only went to three trips over three weeks and it's true","",1
89,"but so but he went in there and I heard something","",1
89,"moving in my ear and","",1
89,"he was you know stealing from my package. Well","",1
89,"then all of a sudden the project ship came out down the side of the","",1
89,"back is missing. I","",1
89,"mean pretty. I didn't see","",1
89,"me. Probably so but then the whole bulk","",1
89,"of the rest of the time the soldiers treat me different","",1
89,"you know. Stop laughing with me that me and my games so the next two weeks of great","",1
89,"after that I went to camp ten years in a row and more blindfolds came","",1
89,"through at that time but I was. I was","",1
89,"the man in their care and. It was a beautiful thing and I was you know one of the","",1
89,"few blacks. Times so I had to deal","",1
89,"with but it was beautiful it was one of the best things that the","",1
89,"photo did you chance to serve","",1
89,"yourself. Right. Stand your ground. Right you know you","",1
89,"know changed my whole life I'm sure you know but how did your parents","",1
89,".","",1
89,"Do. Freezing","",1
89,". Raising a blind faith I think I think they","",1
89,"were true I would have when I you know Run Run","",1
89,"kids with their parents now I'm you know I can't be any more proud.","",1
89,"Do the be me I was forty zero five years","",1
89,"old they sent me to after the Jews few of them went to a Catholic nursery","",1
89,"school people and then.","",1
89,"They let me go downstairs by myself and play with the kids in","",1
89,"the whole neighborhood really watch out for each other so back","",1
89,"then it was you know it was it was it was easy to do it OK","",1
89,". We had everything near our home followed","",1
89,"by ski music to go","",1
89,"on holiday so.","",1
89,"And then you know as as a group it just they just","",1
89,"gave me enough space to learn","",1
89,"but structure so it was it was","",1
89,"tremendous. Never never see","",1
89,". Him.","",1
89,"Nothing could do something so. You","",1
89,"know sighted friends if if if if I got into fights","",1
89,"and and and it seemed like it was all well you know","",1
89,"she wasn't being so you know you live you know","",1
89,"your hero for the by the same token","",1
89,"big on education. I was in a school for the","",1
89,"first year. Six years old I think","",1
89,"it was a school of my neighborhood so they sent me here and they had these classes called","",1
89,"psych conservation and what it was was anybody with our","",1
89,"problems had a base class.","",1
89,"Then you go off to regular classes from nine to twelve and then you come back to this","",1
89,"class to learn","",1
89,"in this school. My mother came one day and there I was in the","",1
89,"class and then the player would think it was one of the kids learn to read","",1
89,"and she just happen to surprise surprise visit. And","",1
89,"the next day I was gone. School I remember I mean I don't","",1
89,"remember all of this and it's down","",1
89,"to P.S.A. and that's when they had the bro class and again this","",1
89,"was not really be with blood because all those other people could","",1
89,"see that you were really totally blind people really in the black","",1
89,"community who knew them and well so mother got me","",1
89,"out of here. Vang school and that was the beginning of","",1
89,". You know again children and she was just. Education","",1
89,"is her name and my father again was the most gracious.","",1
89,"Classy just guide everybody.","",1
89,"I mean he gave to the whole neighborhood to","",1
89,"parties you know it was crowded. Always family","",1
89,"always friends and people on my floor all the kids.","",1
89,"Every every Christmas somebody would get everyone to think I","",1
89,"was brilliant with children so he was","",1
89,"again probably a tie to my kids treated me so","",1
89,"well. But not being honest. You know there are","",1
89,"so you know how he won. So","",1
89,".","",1
89,"These are tremendous people and my whole family really both sides","",1
89,"fantasize from the West Indies a mother son from the south but","",1
89,"but throughout the family there was a disability something","",1
89,"whether you were that word. That this is","",1
89,"a disability but it was gay at the time I was like whoa you know","",1
89,"we weren't we didn't shy away from and we were proud you know really you know","",1
89,"even though you were my cousin. So I mean this is before before I was","",1
89,"working or it's not for you know all of it so you know","",1
89,"we have everything in the family. We had drop outs we're","",1
89,"college grads You know we have lawyers you know bombs","",1
89,"so you know but we all do get","",1
89,"together when it was family time and we all","",1
89,"share this stuff it wasn't you know so it wasn't a big thing you know","",1
89,"it just wasn't a big thing and I went to school and came","",1
89,"up and graduated from Pier Six this is be a six","",1
89,"year Navy sixty you know it can and that's kind","",1
89,"of pretty you know white school in that group. But","",1
89,"that was where the broke last was and when you left early we're going to go to","",1
89,"P.S. one hundred four because that's where they have the lying kids go.","",1
89,"Might be a part of my mother in law school so she said What do you","",1
89,". Think about going to the lines. She used to love that","",1
89,"and God knows that's because it's a Catholic school and then I","",1
89,"found out it was love about all this because I","",1
89,"never really saw you know saw or so through","",1
89,"somebody so I said you have a list of it and that","",1
89,"little guy from my camp and then it kind of it can't later who was","",1
89,"like who was already going there and we became friends","",1
89,". So I went there and","",1
89,"that was the first time that I got a chance to really","",1
89,"play and be on the same level as my peer. You have two","",1
89,"plays with the society. I think you have to adapt to the sighted world","",1
89,"every day I mean I have to worry about finding","",1
89,"work anymore because now I'm wrestling play and","",1
89,"jam and Dane blind people","",1
89,"and it was an unbelievable feeling to know him.","",1
89,"Pretty pretty popular you see us over there. So","",1
89,"yeah yeah but you know I have a lot of so different but this was different","",1
89,"because now I was comparing myself to what my people do","",1
89,"less black people. I wasn't around too many blind people to see what","",1
89,"other blind people do most of my friends say and the only people who were one","",1
89,"of the class and we will all have different great so","",1
89,". I learned to get on a school","",1
89,"bus. There will be a day but again you know you can","",1
89,"find but when you went to this little room and this was","",1
89,"the first of all no one's you know","",1
89,"was it kind of a welcoming thing because I grew up a","",1
89,"Catholic education here you know you're not really because it was a public school","",1
89,"but we had a church in our neighborhood so there. So did","",1
89,"its actions and all that great communion confirmation","",1
89,". So when you're growing up to learn from","",1
89,"other kids you know well I mean if kids can","",1
89,"if I went to a new place. Of course kids would try","",1
89,"to but. I'm you know again that's what","",1
89,"I'm happy to decide the world because","",1
89,"every day you have to adjust","",1
89,"to this other people's world I mean you know it's just the words you're","",1
89,"not doing it you know so and","",1
89,"so I that was definitely learning how to handle","",1
89,"the namecalling ribbing","",1
89,"fighting all of that stuff and how do you","",1
89,"get fused and again. Well that again","",1
89,"it comes back to the tax man and the base of it all you","",1
89,"know. They never.","",1
89,"They never. Told me to go out and start anything","",1
89,"or any fights like that but a very very bad. Ahead of that","",1
89,". If. You'd be teased like that you","",1
89,"know you just have to be ignored.","",1
89,"Work past it because eventually you know that you're going to show them that","",1
89,"you belong. So you know you just have as has had that feeling you know. But it","",1
89,"wasn't like I got approval ratings. So you know so somebody","",1
89,"teased you called evening recently called some back. You totally","",1
89,"ignore them you couldn't really write having to confront them physically right.","",1
89,"As if they were in the projects as they came through. Rob this is somebody who","",1
89,"is well then I can challenge of because I know","",1
89,"that my friends and I've you know I knew inside of my friends in the","",1
89,"neighborhood.","",1
89,"We're going to be around or be there to back me up","",1
89,"so I could be a little more assertive with the physical thing. They're not","",1
89,"school. B. Because I don't want to get a kind of a","",1
89,"mother because you know in school so I can say no","",1
89,"I just sat and you know my mother made sure I was dressed in religious schools","",1
89,"jacket and tie. One oh","",1
89,". Yeah. And now do you know","",1
89,"the phone just a variance dress so. She made sure","",1
89,"that I looked the part. Somebody","",1
89,"deserves to be treated with respect. You know and then when I","",1
89,"went to look at that it was beautiful. But everyone heading home and again","",1
89,"everyone was blind and we had a big view there were grass","",1
89,"track around it. So we go on this field we had a little baseball diamond in it","",1
89,"and we get it we want it we run around this feels pretty big or you know.","",1
89,"It's long and it was an oval shaped track and","",1
89,"field in the middle of so","",1
89,"rotten for the ball and we run go","",1
89,"crazy and you know body slam and pounding","",1
89,"each other playing football making up games we played","",1
89,"baseball waste how to play baseball. Really you","",1
89,"know well as I know you know all of that stuff one way and I don't know how much","",1
89,"time you know supposed to be spent as doctor but what","",1
89,"they mean is all of this stuff really led to a very","",1
89,"wrong I wanted to I was you know a student of music and music","",1
89,"and as I got older Damon actually met my wife there","",1
89,"in the courtroom. Yeah and I was up till I was there to","",1
89,"experience and I met her I came in seventh","",1
89,"grade that she left and came back in eighth grade better that way.","",1
89,"OK she's also she's legally blind. She says when she sees","",1
89,"pretty well you know what for. Vigilantly why.","",1
89,"Yes. But she grew up without school and","",1
89,"then she grew up with white flag issues","",1
89,"so again it was more voters going to college","",1
89,"and that was oh well actually I loved music and high school","",1
89,"and that didn't work out because they knew it was to blind people in the end a","",1
89,"guy whom I told you about and the brother went to camp with me and","",1
89,"several Jackson great great piano player used to be. He","",1
89,"was very warm. But he and he taught","",1
89,"me a lot of really what it was like to","",1
89,"be skilled as a blind person. So we did everything together","",1
89,"and then I went to we went to music you know and got this","",1
89,"bullshit artist to know her teacher Mr","",1
89,"EISENBERG.","",1
89,"He worked for years and what they were supposed to do is transcribe","",1
89,"your stuff into braille so that you can do the work in the classes","",1
89,"you would go in for six weeks at a time and.","",1
89,"He was making us feel like we're not going to be close","",1
89,"because we're black you know so I mean I was just how","",1
89,"well we know that if you only felt you know he","",1
89,"felt and so my mother.","",1
89,"She got me out of school maybe go back to Lavelle when I was in a low grade","",1
89,"but I had a teacher in little girl who","",1
89,"was my best friend and biggest mentor she was a tremendous","",1
89,"sister Mariet and really","",1
89,". Just made me feel like","",1
89,". The way that my mother probably envisioned","",1
89,"everybody treated just like on the","",1
89,"same token I knew that I had the ability to learn. You","",1
89,"know as long as you give me some guidance to this woman was","",1
89,"truly tremendous. So when I","",1
89,"graduated from the. Salutatorian","",1
89,"address and I did a song if I can help somebody and that's my","",1
89,"father's favorite song. And when he does","",1
89,"he I mean just look at those two and used to put it on style","",1
89,"time.","",1
89,"And so I learned to do it for graduation we do it as a class and","",1
89,"that was really the beginning I would say to me really","",1
89,"want to be a professional","",1
89,"school graduate I mean you know we played a rousing groups you know","",1
89,"my top five. And you know","",1
89,"along the way I mean I lost friends teenagers guys that follow the subway","",1
89,"guys get hit by cars by the other guy Tyrone","",1
89,"when we were thirteen. Because we","",1
89,"were really into using a Kaizen to travel around the city. There are","",1
89,"cars hitters but this time I don't think we will do it. I","",1
89,"think we came out of the five and ten. And we had canes and we have power","",1
89,". Over all of us are on the","",1
89,"way up so it is","",1
89,"something so I started to grow and that's","",1
89,"obviously still safe now from our","",1
89,". Core and it","",1
89,"turned out it was that hitters and the","",1
89,"you know my mother blew it along the way as far as gains and Bret goes without a really","",1
89,"great dancer.","",1
89,"I remember you know so we do the trick with","",1
89,"it. We've broken up but","",1
89,"just from that day to now across the street","",1
89,"differently from from that so you know then you know that","",1
89,"I lost that guy's best friend's ironic time is brother was","",1
89,"line systems line so that's why it was so great to","",1
89,"hang around because he had lied. Older siblings and so he learned from","",1
89,"them having to deal with his blinds you know and he just passed it","",1
89,"on to me I mean you know I had an idea but when I actually saw","",1
89,"action with this family how independent they. Were it was","",1
89,"it was something parents","",1
89,"said it was it was only over there that they had signed a girl also","",1
89,"so they had sighted there too and the other thing is you","",1
89,"know but then he you know Jimmy was a good","",1
89,"singer great piano players well systems Gray said","",1
89,"that. He felt this. Way.","",1
89,"Between a costly headache to go stand outside that a Grand","",1
89,"Central Terminal and you know we were","",1
89,"supposed to go to go somewhere else was a dancer","",1
89,". That was the time in the straw","",1
89,"for them for the blind. But","",1
89,"really you know I hope it was a major major","",1
89,"recreational therapy as well as good music thing","",1
89,"still but I wanted to make sure the line people have a place","",1
89,"to to to to remain to play because that taught me so much those are the","",1
89,"values that boy this is one of fourteen.","",1
89,"They really need to be. Able to be us","",1
89,"without.","",1
89,"Because you can't play the same with a sighted person it can't work. So","",1
89,"you can't know the language is different. The whole","",1
89,"dealing is this contact the whole thing I","",1
89,"said you know recreational. We want to make sure because it can't go out","",1
89,"and then the everybody guns it is mainstream agencies. So","",1
89,"now all the black folks stream world","",1
89,"that is less and less places for black people congregate heading","",1
89,"to me just socialized to be home.","",1
89,"And well I know this because I was Main Street. I mean you know I","",1
89,"was being streamed all the early years of my childhood","",1
89,". And I was mainstreamed after I left school when I","",1
89,"left Lavelle. So I was very extreme but you know you want to be","",1
89,"made simple yourself your own people your home hire your own things","",1
89,"your own way to let you guard down so you know I don't. After years bump into","",1
89,"something new that I do know that Lori is not going to jump up to help me I","",1
89,"can do this because you want your","",1
89,"brother or you know so you know so when","",1
89,"you get that you start. Taste in","",1
89,"escrow and then you come outside and play and decided it was my play","",1
89,"because now I know I have a base. They hang on here. It was","",1
89,"great you know I can already hear from people because I have","",1
89,"days before it was a necessity I have to do it because this is the only","",1
89,"way to her one time to learn about life.","",1
89,"We review within each other's space","",1
89,". That's going outside and it's so much easier because","",1
89,"now I mean I didn't have to worry about you know every","",1
89,"little thing and develop my skills to be better out there","",1
89,"from being with the people.","",1
89,"With their interest in time learning how to get around the city","",1
89,". You're pretty intense if you","",1
89,"just for the maneuver you well are stock streets I","",1
89,"started a little well where do you take this one","",1
89,"and I started when I didn't travel","",1
89,"before so I was like.","",1
89,"Love twelve maybe a little tear over care","",1
89,"and then he was a child. So I came home from Cameroon here","",1
89,"sort of the black guy lives right around here and","",1
89,"he travels and he","",1
89,"or she goes well","",1
89,". You know the cello and but I don't know","",1
89,"how as to how to learn learn how to do this so.","",1
89,"She said When you go a little well if you you will find out from there how","",1
89,"you can learn how to use a cane and that's where they","",1
89,"used to cane used to came and I hadn't seen Time","",1
89,"for like seventy eight years old I was taking music lessons at the","",1
89,"lighthouse. But every one of these take me down you know we went to see","",1
89,"it go down for guitar lessons like that but every time I","",1
89,"hear the director he has C O two","hear the director he has C O two",2
89,"and a seeing eye dog I was like. Want to do this","",1
89,"and I couldn't believe that these dogs were that trained and well","",1
89,"behaved and yet they were trying to convince me that it is","",1
89,"a pet. Also once you know what. So I","",1
89,"thought it would be treat about this thing that Kate was great","thought it would be treat about this thing that Kate was great",2
89,"and I had a great mobility instructor this guy used to work at the lighthouse","and I had a great mobility instructor this guy used to work at the lighthouse",1

89,"that as a no. Go.","that as a no. Go.",2
89,"Shoes so but then I realized it was like a toy it was like it","",1
89,"you know and then I started walking around the city myself like to school in different neighborhoods","",1
89,"different neighborhoods grocery store restaurants to get","",1
89,"to five P. to stop when I was into this that I realized I could","",1
89,"hear oh well you know he'd say.","",1
89,"What are you passing. He goes What do you","",1
89,"wonder they said they came","",1
89,"for the cave and it was an on and then I go on House. Also","",1
89,"notice he said.","",1
89,"That if you go back home.","",1
89,"OK this is the I mean this is","",1
89,"really happening then I start again.","",1
89,"Caffeinated and using all of that stuff to walk around the city","",1
89,"and then sixteen","",1
89,". To work because. I heard it","",1
89,"sixteen years ago. So we call the school","",1
89,"you know I mean you know no you can't get it done. Eighteen because","",1
89,". You have to. Or","",1
89,"we don't think this school person. In a city situation","",1
89,"really be responsible because we know they are going to","",1
89,"respond. And","",1
89,"any money could pay. But all of a sudden","",1
89,"Tyrone and I seem to get it done.","",1
89,"Now I always want to box me but","",1
89,"I don't work. I don't litter boxes but I don't challenge it","",1
89,"consumes a thousand dollars. I","",1
89,"mean it was that it was like Christmas you get there.","",1
89,"All of us have a little dog","",1
89,"and both of us have shutters. So I think my","",1
89,"mother and father also got them to say listen when a great many","",1
89,"will show. Her shots","",1
89,"better than well those are small I don't want to say for sure and it is definitely more","",1
89,"protective because a shepherd that's there instead was a lab is everybody love","",1
89,"you know but so we got the shepherd","",1
89,". Now so it was called you go back to room they","",1
89,"gave us the first day like how to do stuff and they gave us an","",1
89,"equipment and well the kind of stuff to expect for the next three weeks in","",1
89,"this class and they were sixteen years old now and so we're really on the spot here. Women","",1
89,"you know we want we want. Route we want to play","",1
89,"and we couldn't wait we're so excited about them and you go out they go","",1
89,"on your own. So did it work with","",1
89,"you the whole day before the taking long walks with honors and everything","",1
89,"and then when you come in the room","",1
89,"called me do you mean just like that","",1
89,". This is mine now and then I started describing","",1
89,"all this is this is a dream come true right","",1
89,"now and there. Are some of","",1
89,"those later. So when I think back to that experience with","",1
89,"crazy we were nuts. All of us we got a dog that","",1
89,"year ten of our friends and they opened up","",1
89,"for them so we would terrorize the city. Twelve","",1
89,"thirteen of us walk around the city on wood dot","",1
89,"org food on or through the city going to places we","",1
89,"went overnight where we took the bus to","",1
89,"the train in Watertown. It was like fifteen miles walk at night of the","",1
89,"night. Done in the days like","",1
89,"that it was all of us with these dogs I mean these dogs walk I","",1
89,"want to go I was like writing cards once you move on with that","",1
89,"train. It's. It's the most rewarding","",1
89,"feeling. It's a lot of work though and that's why people.","",1
89,"Don't want to work. Responsibility to keep it","",1
89,"clean taking keep it on the train keep discipline","",1
89,". Especially the first six months when you get","",1
89,"to has no idea what to do doesn't own you you don't know","",1
89,"them you have to learn to trust the bond work","",1
89,"and you have to stay sane have","",1
89,"clearance for so you know","",1
89,"and then when you go. No it's a song over here and you're so used to","",1
89,"the other.","",1
89,"You like this because your dog he","",1
89,"was with us. Yes he's You've had him for eight years she she's a","",1
89,"beautiful you know.","",1
89,"All of those are totally different someone who","",1
89,"someone. You know OK you know pick their","",1
89,"spots and this one was a Labrador mentality","",1
89,". She is the sweetest to tool fall was the sweetest","",1
89,"really. But we were the first","",1
89,"sixteen you know and","",1
89,"that's because and traveling and I still use the cane I mean I still get around or use a cane","",1
89,"to go to the game and then twenty years ago","",1
89,"it came in play so I use that","",1
89,". As what is","",1
89,"excessive reading is yes it's a pageant kind of. For our system for","",1
89,"disabled people in the cities around the country","",1
89,". Oh no not so there is not a","",1
89,"sheriff if you don't know you know every","",1
89,"day you use the new schedule of the four so you have to really you","",1
89,"have to go. You call up right and they make an appointment. Me give you a","",1
89,"schedule so you know how to work with that we call it stress a","",1
89,"lot of times it will show coldly and but I would be if I","",1
89,"didn't have them because come on. Three three one. I will it will be taken. So","",1
89,"that's the other they see as I've gotten older. How slow down","",1
89,"change the travel situation","",1
89,". With happened and why you did you go through","",1
89,"I didn't finish because near the end I was just so","",1
89,"thrilled for me so I was visually it is","",1
89,"again probably light on an area and I have a","",1
89,"ninety six credits.","",1
89,"But I was pleased to hear that you and I","",1
89,"said nothing to us. So","",1
89,"yeah so and now I don't regret I mean I guess","",1
89,"you know try. To choose something","",1
89,"but I don't think it's hurt me because I don't want to be a music teacher and I","",1
89,"really didn't want to be a recreational therapist I just wanted to make sure like the place to","",1
89,"play you know because my whole thing is when I see it today is that","",1
89,"when one of the play. If you can't read then he","",1
89,"don't socialize and if you can socialize having a long","",1
89,"job if you know people here so I was hoping","",1
89,"that you know I won't be easy. And. Then I went really wrong","",1
89,"got into this music thing and knife back and","",1
89,"then early eighties are relevant to this. To this","",1
89,"master beautiful piano player called Barry Harris he's a","",1
89,"legend. He's a vocal he's a piano","",1
89,". Teacher But the guy is eighty eight now split with","",1
89,"everyone. All you can do. All very hammers","",1
89,"I. Can but see this low and yes they go in jazz Coltrane","",1
89,"through twentieth Street. So I used to go around there and just hang in","",1
89,"listen learn to see how these chairs these creatures we've","",1
89,"come through. Freddie Blakey you know","",1
89,"all oh and just play all day all night and it was beautiful","",1
89,"stuff away from the couch they have to","",1
89,"look at something I don't want to do Jewish girl like you","",1
89,"know the problem is shot so embarrassed and I was like","",1
89,"What. In the late seventy's in seventy","",1
89,"nine I needed good music was a common","",1
89,". Song. Yeah. I wasn't sure so","",1
89,"I went to the state well which is","",1
89,"why I don't know a couple of friends and Stan's","",1
89,"I don't want to stand out among other. Side","",1
89,"of the standings you know the","",1
89,". Size and it was","",1
89,"us. So when I started to feel better","",1
89,"certainly no peace about then","",1
89,". Then","",1
89,"and I was able then to work seven years.","",1
89,"All right we're going to work","",1
89,"here. If I don't put stuff but the","",1
89,"drawback was is that I am going to have a lot of stuff because most of","",1
89,"the stuff is inside so I had to sit there in the room. I","",1
89,"couldn't do cigarettes because I knew that they would take up a lot of space","",1
89,"can so I was only doing magazines and","",1
89,"newspapers. So that's you know. How.","",1
89,"To use used to come by and say the. Floor","",1
89,"clerk in one. Phrase and zero degrees come by they","",1
89,"I'm coming by you because I know you're always open. It's amazing you're always","",1
89,"open and then you know I write","",1
89,"that column and I thought of the other musicians from across the street","",1
89,". That's how area stays shoeshine guy cross-tree told me","",1
89,"about it and that's when I started going to jazz clubs. What's going on here","",1
89,". But in jazz is the music work. Singer","",1
89,"then eighty six my first big gig that's","",1
89,".","",1
89,"Three. Three other people.","",1
89,"I just got a a gret ten thousand and eight grand","",1
89,"to do three produced three counters is first one's life","",1
89,"was beautiful. And","",1
89,". My father came in and had a massive heart","",1
89,"attack that night at the door and I didn't know until the concert","",1
89,"was all stars and people to see him","",1
89,"you know as I look back I said you seem weird","",1
89,"because everyone was being too nice to me","",1
89,"you know. This joke in the goal line","",1
89,"and everybody was this. You know the senator","",1
89,"was that was a guest on one thing. She just seemed very quiet.","",1
89,"Everyone knew. Except me. I mean","",1
89,"you know your father had a hard time getting counseling","",1
89,"games brother. But we want to know if you want to go on it","",1
89,". So I sit here I have to do you just","",1
89,"a mother to go. To the. Hospital. I thought they were","",1
89,"talking about my stepfather. Because he just came out of the hospital","",1
89,"with our father they had a heart problem. So I","",1
89,"just thought of a concert that I don't even take","",1
89,"today. I hear they say","",1
89,".","",1
89,"It's. Michael.","",1
89,"I'm a liar. It wasn't me","",1
89,". Yeah well it's that","",1
89,"event three years. OK so","",1

89,"children's dresses and when he","",1
89,"has his whole company closed again. If","",1
89,"you love this guy was. So. And","",1

89,"energy to do is","",1
89,"you know it really is the way. He","",1
89,"just uses beautiful man.","",1
89,"I got all of that. My mother on the other hand was the host. She knew","",1
89,"everybody and the door was always open for people to come","",1
89,"and see the modern hats off injury so the","",1
89,"but I mean that's who these people were and even when they","",1
89,"lost what was right around when I was thirteen","",1
89,"and I was. And we're just all","",1
89,"projects. Speaking of people bothering me","",1
89,"but you know I've started feeling like I don't make friends here because","",1
89,"we just moved from all my old friends. So","",1
89,"OK as it is used to go see a little.","",1
89,"Oh oh","",1
89,"oh oh.","",1
89,"So I think about what some of those I think you know status","",1

89,"chance but trust that you have to trust though you have to trust that person is","",1
89,"walking. And then you have to listen","",1
89,"listen to this person because I was just able and","",1
89,"you're. Hearing your voice is just an","",1
89,"extension of what your eyes and Shona people really are","",1
89,"you know whatever your eyes do. That's how you know so","",1
89,"it's very interesting. People's voice","",1
89,"sometimes to trust them or trust them or pick up a moment you know","",1
89,"that some of us trust them on this trip because everyone has their you know","",1

89,"Consistency with the people I know a lot of people but for","",1
89,"a second. So I knew people and I","",1

89,"was I would take no more than a five dollar bill you know singles from that","",1
89,"but are trying to now if I","",1

89,"years and then discuss Hondas you know right","",1
89,"people. Margaret you're stammering. Yes","",1
89,"And I said you know I will make you less space","",1
89,"SAME DAMN with me. Now.","",1
89,"Almost three hours and they're going","",1
89,"to go through all this stuff.","",1
89,"Turns out nothing but I know that like like","",1
89,"we had in my room","",1
89,". We had it.","",1
89,"Right. We had a talking machine because","",1
89,"we had boxes and boxes. Of. Talking Books","",1
89,". They caught it right into the records to","",1
89,"vote so we have stacks of paper","",1
89,". We have stacks of time zone in my room now at","",1
89,"all than yours and you form your slothful all on","",1
89,"books on music. Well you know we had a real tape","",1
89,"recorder because we had textbooks on reel to reel so if you were","",1
89,"reading something in a text wise. Go back to it","",1
89,"later on like to study for something. Come. You know you have","",1
89,"twenty reels of the box and you get a real","",1
89,"six and find whatever you're looking","",1

89,"People print challenge Well you're dyslexic or","",1
89,"why. Or. How to use the product","",1
89,"that was so sweet. Because I think every black person should know this","",1
89,"if I go to the city.","",1
89,"I'm not lost anymore.","",1
89,"I don't feel lost because I can always use the G.P.S.","",1
89,"to navigate around town so I can find a","",1
89,"restaurant from Tucson sector the most","",1
89,"activation will use my phone. OK so if","",1
89,"you go to access ability. And you look down you see you're going to see something.","",1
89,"Voice over. You go voice over turning around. And it will","",1
89,"start speaking to you. It speeds up all the ups and","",1
89,"downs. But there's gestures to learn how to","",1
89,"navigate through it. Once you turn around like you're tapping the","",1
89,"screen door that opens","",1
89,"the gestures the whole thing work","",1
89,"and then you have all different hundreds and hundreds of apps.","",1
89,"You go there and you know that are made specifically for blood like","",1
89,"Reader tap tap I can take a picture of you and it will tell me.","",1
89,"Man I'm so close. Greatest or you know overly Smiley","",1
89,"tapped out and it's only getting better. We now have a","",1
89,"decent. Text. To speech.","",1
89,"Where we take a picture of the print and you know read it","",1
89,"you know and they all of my books now and you know","",1
89,"like I said they're edgy there has a book out. Most likely it will be up here and I","",1
89,"can bring down a five second bone read where it was in college","",1
89,"when you went to college you had to wait for those attacks those real real","",1
89,"boxes that come into your room six weeks eight weeks later because","",1
89,"you had all the book especially for you or you had a","",1
89,"reader. Nothing out there but it just it took a long time for","",1
89,"them because other people would be using it you know","",1
89,"so it's you know you know read them until four","",1
89,"to six weeks later. And. I play catch up and sure enough","",1
89,"or you have a reader which most my life for you and I would say","",1
89,"all other one black folks are going to try and play","",1
89,"well and I would. I was on trial here","",1
89,"and they would get a reader and they would have to read to you know me forever you","",1
89,"know people take all that stuff is in the form","",1
89,". Really.","",1
89,"And then to have you know four thousand tools at your disposal","",1
89,"which are you going to be able to learn lyrics","",1
89,"goal of some of the sheet music to religion I can write in braille","",1
89,"for me trying to listen to a song every time","",1
89,"tomorrow on bones and I you know","",1
89,"and. When I first got hooked on to the. Well technology","",1
89,"so I was grueling. Whatever came out. OK","",1
89,"Well OK","",1
89,"I'm going to one of the conventions with counseling line","",1
89,"and there's a national convention that it's all over the United","",1
89,"States are different and you get three thousand blind people from","",1
89,"all over the world for we can have at","",1
89,"this place lawyers doctors and all all","",1
89,"vendors all professions. Come to this day","",1
89,"maybe five to eight hundred dogs who. Will. Let you","",1
89,"go and this guy will came","",1
89,"in and he showed us this. Touchless","",1
89,"screen. Monitor. This doesn't","",1
89,"make sense that I'm going to show one person touch a screen with the exact.","",1
89,"It's where he goes will you do with it will be like the","",1
89,"US and I don't know the music so who are","",1
89,"going and he said well I used to be on here","",1
89,"and. How do you like the way this play played","",1
89,"back and this is my sentencing to it is","",1
89,"something to say it was clear. Oh","",1
89,"there he goes. So","",1
89,"yeah OK let's say happy birthday and that","",1
89,"same day there. And I so hope","",1
89,"you see it.","",1
89,"So he slowly then I won't back him","",1
89,"and just sounds like a lot of work.","",1
89,"He goes look how easy like chess. Yes","",1
89,"yes well. Well yes but","",1
89,"you know I'm still in there and I know he was","",1
89,". An oversight of your story here and","",1
89,"the moving piece in the","",1
89,"back of your home for he did not go over because I","",1
89,"had a chest computer just challenges that I have to do it.","",1
89,"When he showed me that I was it was the","",1
89,"this is it I mean I can't imagine living without","",1
89,"them because music we really wouldn't be seen","",1
89,"today if it was because just learn","",1
89,".","",1
89,"To listen.","",1
89,"Leaving your wife or your wife or child together","",1
89,"and I was that was a beautiful thing to do because you know","",1
89,"I went to this little girl and I was like girls you know but","",1
89,". I want to live the first year I met a","",1
89,"lot of the blinders on longer than I actually","",1
89,"like them and because in the same thing","",1
89,"again I had to get them here I don't have","",1
89,"to you know they like for I didn't do it but I was also","",1
89,"not especially if I sang you know somebody came saying","",1
89,"you know where it is a silent world our special blind","",1
89,"side here but when I got in there","",1
89,"she came in eighth grade year. She was shy","",1
89,". And it made me so close.","",1
89,"Because. You know she had a","",1
89,"couple of them were friends and stuff","",1
89,"and. Choose to live in Paul and","",1
89,"so I used to go on weekends. She'd stayed at the school","",1
89,"week and I was there and you know her her family","",1
89,"and me took me right in like I was a lot of family","",1
89,"and then broke out after the three graduated high","",1
89,"school and maybe sort of the once in awhile you want to use","",1
89,"it but I was embarrassed college the first year she was up and duchess","",1
89,"Tsotsi maybe you know once or twice that I came back and you","",1
89,"and I assume that about two years later","",1
89,". Oh you know","",1
89,"Billy Louise and your work all","",1
89,"of us to live another day.","",1
89,"So I called her up and. She told me when she was living with us and let me come","",1
89,"back and say you know I","",1
89,"never left. It was unbelievable and then","",1
89,"and then having a kid I mean it was my worry","",1
89,"was. How am I going to do with my father did for","",1
89,"me. Teacher I was skiing right. Ride a bike","",1
89,". Just you know not having to be","",1
89,"afraid of introducing her blind father to other people. How I'm going to do","",1
89,"this I was not worried but then I saw fell into place much more","",1
89,"she you know she was just naturally a good","",1
89,"guy as far as the blind thing and and we","",1
89,"had you know we had friends.","",1
89,"She saw that she was a baby so you know people dealt with","",1
89,"me and nobody ever said anything about the blood and gore made her feel","",1
89,"uncomfortable. So I think it is more war with","",1
89,"and then after that we had a long hallway and I see this","",1
89,"tape around the hallway and have a ride the bike up and then all to you know balance and","",1
89,"then skating out take it to a little playground where I knew it was only one entrance","",1
89,"and one out and just you know letters to the teacher I was skate","",1
89,"skate we're a little bit and I don't know.","",1
89,"So while I go outside and find a parking","",1
89,"place I find people that I would","",1
89,"listen to see who see themselves as there will","",1
89,"be eyes for me and so I was going over the years","",1
89,"and then we start talking about some of these Cubana","",1
89,"tells us to rest on the right.","",1
89,"Well well I see how it's changed though because now","",1
89,"you know and maybe because it's not. I don't think so","",1
89,"you know I think you know because you guys come on but I will let","",1
89,"it go. There's no way I could go to a park with feel","",1
89,"comfortable in this thing is that with all of the stuff.","",1
89,"So I don't know how I do it but that's what it is you know hope","",1
89,"and you know by six he has a little more control over what","",1
89,"he is doing and not doing then you know me you know and","",1
89,"I can I can do it but me and my kid we used to go out I used to go on long","",1
89,"walks with two years old you know just walk the neighborhood","",1
89,"here.","",1
89,"Here we go.","",1
89,"It was a beautiful day and she's a beautiful young lady","",1
89,"very respectful like blind people","",1
89,"love her. Because she treats them not only","",1
89,"that she's just a friend.","",1
89,"So we love our work","",1
89,". You know very well Brussels. She","",1
89,"lives in a low right here.","",1
89,"She and this kid is treated to be","",1
89,"lovers because he calls movie though we don't know where","",1
89,"that cave on because when he was when he was really pleased to","",1
89,"say for me and Bob could see red blood red.","",1
89,"OK So he started about right now because","",1
89,"he has a sense that one thing he did he may cause","",1
89,"cancer is merely because you know so but he knows now that","",1
89,"so they can see you but with me you know I'm walking he comes.","",1
89,"Got you around or are","",1
89,"we playing ball. Is playing ball or to to catch","",1
89,"he'll make sure I stand up against the Tories","",1
89,"sort of walking past. OK because if I do of","",1
89,"the five so they let","",1
89,"you stay here it hits the wall and comes back at me","",1
89,"so. You know","",1
89,"you go outside I mean like I feel like I'm training like this that we went to the park","",1
89,"but I always make sure you know you can see but","",1
89,"you know he sees me and he knows that we're friends he's very","",1
89,"social. He loves me. So his grandson which","",1
89,"is really just them again seeing the future right in front of you","",1
89,"can touch you can touch the future. So that's","",1
89,"when I started record setting see the business hours I have to","",1
89,"go and leave","",1
89,". Something","",1
89,". Are you working on","",1
89,".","",1
89,"Yes I don't live there. I don't write music through high school","",1
89,"to college that much because all the books on tape","",1
89,"now computer I mean you know","",1
89,"maybe to label stuff like. Suit The CD is","",1
89,". A label I don't even have to label Kansas stuff","",1
89,"anymore because I. Thought oh I'm really here to","",1
89,"stay. Bob you know cases I can read the","",1
89,"barcode will tell","",1
89,"you it's really good but in","",1
89,"the right one can it's not you know","",1
89,"when you get the barcode then the park hotels you know","",1
89,"what's in it or it will take you to a surgeon","",1
89,"if you're looking for to have it to do. Now instructions right on it can","",1
89,"tell you where the clear me or the","",1
89,"tap tap seems to read that it can be is the text to","",1
89,"speech operator and it really is the natural for the ridge line","",1
89,"that is an arm's length. That protects civil rights for","",1
89,"black people and laws make sure the laws","",1
89,". Are for you know a favor and a seat is the same","",1
89,"thing. It's like Republican and Democrat they're both so different really","",1
89,"has little or no difference. Well I'm going to be","",1
89,"very radical but they get stuff done and they really really really","",1
89,"focus on young people. Solutions. Collars","",1
89,". AC D.C. probably by the","",1
89,"way has prejudiced against same folks I think I mean they","",1
89,"don't help they don't want to help came here","",1
89,"and the National Federation became real. Yeah","",1
89,"but this. So they are very radical and they do want to charge","",1
89,"stuff they didn't like the strength. On the side of the","",1
89,"platform. So. All of this is true.","",1
89,"Yes it's tacked on so you can feel it. So","",1
89,"you know they want this because it draws too much attention to","",1
89,"blind people. What exactly.","",1
89,"Any time you use a line like a line to drive use of","",1
89,"the roads I mean to say they are and even this","",1
89,"means to you as well you know","",1
89,"I mean this is","",1
89,". A city really relies on side of","",1
89,"people too much here when everybody was against this","",1
89,"stuff. Lawyers and everyone you know as a whole you got a little","",1
89,"it's pretty good it's pretty interesting actually. But without them we'd be","",1
89,"nothing strange.","",1
89,"Both. Are human Reserve","",1
89,". Remember I am I was a member of the earlier kind","",1
89,"of. But outside so I mean you","",1
89,"know I go for the convention. So the conventions of a great state that","",1
89,"I have based player week earlier","",1
89,"and I'm also bowlers Of All right Will we go to every","",1
89,"state every year is so different","",1
89,"than I do you know","",1
89,"they have rails so on the approach you know","",1
89,"so wherever you are so the real pros and you used a","",1
89,"real rock. Guy You","",1
89,"can't of course he has now of course the the","",1
89,". Tolly why if you bowl","",1
89,". I would say the average maybe could be like","",1
89,"fifteen. But my friend the guy talking","",1
89,"about the way you know it's like OK well he was a","",1
89,"villain. So we don't need these things but his average is","",1
89,"one forty five and if so why","",1
89,". So it really does depend. I","",1
89,"am all for I don't understand","",1
89,"why can't you know the","",1
89,"games and it was the only or much younger","",1
89,"you know Facebook project kids you know like from childhood","",1
89,"and kids I want to turn to see all of the tunnel","",1
89,"and becomes a Facebook friend caring Rose was my","",1
89,"best friend in the projects and we used to sing in state cases every day","",1
89,". So we found each other a fun friends and I","",1
89,"love it. So F.B.A. right now is one. I mean that","",1
89,"is that that is the connection for the community","",1
89,"and especially if you're a person you know it's a","",1
89,"great privilege there.","",1
89,"I don't really I love it here. Do.","",1
89,"You. Do for current events","",1
89,".","",1
89,"Bummer for all of","",1
89,"us like now to be there and then","",1
89,". The struggles of in general","",1
89,". I believe that the man at the face and then","",1
89,"in you know in the face. Of racism","",1
89,"still exists. Unfortunately the entire","",1
89,"country and world. So yeah I follow that stuff and","",1
89,". I just don't like talking about it because","",1
89,". Everybody saw now. One day when it comes to parties these days","",1
89,"are really good views that you don't want to step in the wrong staircase","",1
89,"or surgeons are","",1
89,"here anyway and so","",1
89,"you know why holidays are getting to know who","",1
89,"you are.","",1
89,"No no no if you can handle. If we're not on the same page you","",1
89,". Know. So well. Spoilers on a sports","",1
89,"freak school's football","",1
89,"baseball basketball boxing","",1
89,"is not anymore but I was about harming our leaders.","",1
89,"Doesn't one person go for about","",1
89,"five years and that is a tremendous game for blind people to an indoor","",1
89,"or plated gym on the floor but it's within the","",1
89,"ball as hard as you can. So for power for.","",1
89,"All those. You have to","",1
89,"score goals three and it's a tremendous","",1
89,"sport. Jim But I love walking on","",1
89,"Wall Street here","",1
89,"and you.","",1
89,"Know and again use a little I was like OK","",1
89,"God so I still love go through different","",1
89,"neighborhoods using knowing that I have those hearing skills","",1
89,"medical news today just to","",1
89,"get another dog but I think this will be my last but I've said that for six","",1
89,"years. It's just so you know music more workers are reduced to","",1
89,"you know be responsible for the dog and users","",1
89,"period and then my life and then you know want to go from","",1
89,"home you know. But yeah she is families","",1
89,"that are still insistent you know and we used to retire","",1
89,"while I was trying to do so because we knew","",1
89,"we had to go. Then last month I can't choose so","",1
89,"I said this is it on one year and has long","",1
89,"been out of the most out of those two months.","",1
89,"So I told them when I realized I was walking","",1
89,". On said I","",1
89,".","",1
89,"Hate you. You understand cite","",1
89,"references for our talk. All","",1
89,". Right. I was","",1
89,".","",1
89,"Tested that was","",1
89,"the by far the","",1
89,"most asked. Question everyone","",1
89,"because their faith in Him like I","",1
89,"haven't seen how can a perceived moment really well you","",1
89,"know you know it's really you know saw or","",1
89,"you can imagine you can describe a painting all you want","",1
89,"to be.","",1
89,"Live be sure of his life right now. Even","",1
89,"if you go there I have a daughter line","",1
89,"artist. He can they can give him","",1
89,"up and you know describe it and you can fake it","",1
89,"really so it's obviously there's something in there","",1
89,". Sure thinking of glass to go","",1
89,"green but you know and then you go amazing blind people","",1
89,"volunteer for your kid that was","",1
89,"fifteen but it was licensed to who can walk around the streets","",1
89,"without a cane or anything you could skate because you can hear every object and","",1

89,"Have you asked the question. Oh yes yes a lot.","",1
89,"Oh yeah so so.","",1
89,"Well I'm going to emphasize it was but I can't see what you can see","",1
89,"that about. As beautiful","",1
89,". We're going to take me to the","",1
89,"bottom of the mountain and often is the ball so I","",1
89,"can't even imagine size and the size of an elephant","",1
89,"ten years ago actually kind of the manager.","",1
89,"First of all those interested in the cloud and you","",1
89,"know they are big because that's all you know you know but I've never","",1
89,"actually touched one so I don't know I threw my leg around.","",1
89,"Let's kick somebody because they were sitting on the other side of the elephant.","",1
89,"I didn't know you would have won nothing only where all it was","",1
89,"just massive and like oh well I love you know this","",1
89,"dolphin You know so I can't even imagine the","",1
89,"size of the. Third. Thing","",1
89,"it's so size is the main thing that I can cover you know if it's","",1
89,"if it's beyond my hand to","",1
89,"so we're actually using and you can get an idea of life","",1
89,"size figures like a president can kill you","",1
89,"and one of them went on and this was fun","",1
89,". We were in that zone in those days","",1
89,". And that's where the convention was here and he used to be a very","",1
89,"healthy we were all in the same line","",1
89,"and somebody said OK now we're coming up to you love you know","",1
89,"you know what. You know we're feeling all of these Kennedy","",1
89,"Michael Jackson and actually and we were","",1

89,"it with","",1
89,"every Yeah I can.","",1
89,"But then it will throw","",1
89,"up.","",1
89,"But the amazing thing about and often he said when you when you see one with it it's going to","",1
89,"drop you off.","",1
89,"All over the other and then you just wait here for a","",1
89,"surprise and said OK and that's how they said they were","",1
89,"when they dropped me off and really warm to","",1
89,"drink. You know they may run right away from everybody","",1
89,"else and it is more due to more","",1
89,"until the train came. They must go and","",1
89,"feel something you know blind.","",1
89,"So yeah I was just in and you know now the next summer","",1

89,"which up to that point I was afraid to go and you know I mean people","",1
89,"are kind and. Friendly you","",1
89,"know. Because my dreams","",1
89,"I want to work on people","",1
89,"and stuff. They love jazz and they love","",1
89,"black people whom years you know. So I want to go I mean","",1
89,"if you know you know some of my site was","",1
89,"you know out of those because it is they're","",1

89,"I have a great jazz piano where great jazz","",1
89,"Japanese. Bass player and","",1
89,". You know there's some nice drummers is great","",1
89,". He loved jazz.","",1
89,"Theory and he loved One thing I mean really it's so funny here","",1
89,"because here they don't seem to go up on","",1
89,"black people over there you go over there. It's it's like","",1
89,"why the subways are made for you know everything is already","",1
89,"sounds are all there for them for them right. Well you know you know I'm going","",1
89,"through all of that as we go through here just to get all traffic","",1
89,"lights.","",1
89,"Oh you feel. Black people are treated here. What","",1
89,"accommodations made for them were black people.","",1
89,"It's tough to yeah thanks and F.E.M.A. see the attitudes","",1
89,"are changing. It's so you know","",1
89,"it's always going to be a work in progress and they really really like. Right","",1
89,"now some of them a documentary about me being featured with two of them are","",1
89,"pros. How are we going around New York City. So this is right in there","",1
89,"with us this stuff. They","",1
89,". Well you know it's","",1
89,"just.","",1
89,"Trying and that's a lot of dialogue and dark is tremendous. Just trying to","",1
89,"get people to be aware of the fact that you know yes","",1
89,"we are human. You know we have feelings","",1
89,"and so when you talk about us we're going to hear you you","",1
89,"know I would say that that is the biggest problem","",1
89,"right now so you know you get people to listen to","",1
89,"what you have to be strong and you know that you know they get people to","",1
89,"understand that you're talking to me you know talking about.","",1
89,"Look at me after","",1
89,"oh they're sure if you know","",1
89,"what I want to because","",1
89,"there's more ha ha but if we went to a","",1
89,"supermarket or stores like there you","",1
89,"know so","",1
89,"well you know there is a you know if you go online there is","",1
89,"a thing actually in the ACB","",1
89,"website rules on how you conduct yourself when","",1
89,"you're in the presence of a person like you know little things","",1
89,"that people of course think the main do when you leave the","",1
89,"room I don't know if you've. Gotten someone you know coming","",1
89,"to you know to seize their hand down to the back to take over from you","",1
89,"know you know off the ball because you're happy for you","",1
89,"to go. The rules are","",1
89,"simple. Well you know verified and","",1
89,". Says that sighted people go I","",1
89,"mean I don't live the same way when it comes to get on with their feet","",1
89,"and so I just did a play last season with two blind","",1
89,"was suffering a lot of you to death","",1
89,". And centered around a game that we had to play","",1
89,"but it was all about how long are we going to get to communicate","",1
89,"with one another I don't know sometime but you know learning all the little things and I","",1
89,"have a deaf cousin who was a professor at the university in","",1
89,"Arkansas so I know the music he feels through","",1
89,"wishing he had a better stereo than anyone I'm going to fall back in","",1
89,"love because he started the vibration of","",1
89,"music he can feel the whole CD so","",1
89,"I actually I asked the same question why are","",1
89,"you not me you know you know how fascinating but I say to people","",1
89,"that there's no way. And of course people say they'd","",1
89,"rather have their ears. I cannot imagine not being able to","",1
89,"walk out of here. Go outside and say hey","",1
89,"somebody I just can't you know","",1
89,"but a deaf person. They have their own community. It's hard to come out of","",1
89,"your own community if nobody else you know. Whereas I","",1
89,"have the opportunity to come out of my community because we can still communicate","",1
89,"interests but I have to see questions all of them. How do you try","",1
89,"how do you talk with people I mean do you know how to work","",1
89,"with all of it. Yeah I mean","",1
89,"my mother in college this is","",1
89,"the line to mind again and why are you","",1
89,"sure you were going to stop. Oh well I don't","",1
89,"communicate. She was very beautiful woman.","",1
89,"So when she had the thing all around and","",1
89,"so solve it. You try to cheat","",1
89,".","",1
89,"Pin comes up with the six starts running and I","",1
89,"could see that so much that you know I thought","",1
89,"she's right in Braille and I'm reading in Braille she's driving home from a","",1
89,"little time and then if I wanted to write to.","",1
89,"She turned it around. Writers were so but one of the","",1
89,"subtle you know ROOM.","",1
89,"So one of those layers.","",1
89,"The again as.","",1
89,"I think it was one of the first plane reached out all the","",1
89,"seas three because as you know she didn't","",1
89,"know and I just you know it's","",1
89,"not going to be all mine","",1
89,".","",1
89,"Then the rain came out you know it alls read and then I was","",1
89,"online. Blind and live","",1
89,". Oh it was","",1
89,"so he even notices that I was","",1
89,"wondering if you can say.","",1
89,"That's right and I know that some people say they go like","",1
89,".","",1
89,"They're fascinated me love you know","",1
89,"so I asked the same questions that's why I really understand and","",1
89,"also what people don't tell kids to ask","",1
89,"the question if the gosh","",1
89,"he's you don't know because this is a liberal","",1
89,"who remembers you know should","",1
89,"be like you do person they can see what","",1
89,"that they can't see you do","",1
89,"you but you know you say she could see","",1
89,"she would be like and how do you do it","",1
89,"just like that.","",1
89,"You know","",1
89,"it's like you know it's to me","",1
89,"it's the game of love teaching.","",1
89,"People not on the list but people I was listening to you","",1
89,". You know the woods you could see","",1
89,"I mean of course I don't feel that I ever see but","",1
89,"I just I marvel at the power of people's psyche","",1
89,"and I can hear the bus three blocks away. So for me to imagine that","",1
89,"you could see that bus is like magic to me you know or that you know you","",1
89,"could see the number on a train or","",1
89,"something like that stuff like that to","",1
89,"be able to just open a book and read it.","",1
89,"It's amazing stuff to me or to be able to cross through","",1
89,"I mean I want to go to war. Another one of my","",1
89,"dreams is to still","",1
89,"leaves once that floor will feel so that I can use my","",1
89,"years to see those you know I was so far away you can't you","",1
89,"guys you know when I went to mass college the football does that cause when","",1
89,"I got back in here. I can hear the curse I can hear them talk. That's like","",1
89,"seeing me you know so so I you know I was","",1
89,"I mean you know when we said no Mr you know Mr seat","",1
89,"you can hear the both of them on the street you","",1
89,"know but.","",1
89,"It's it's it's the power so I think it's just an","",1
89,"amazing amazing day and I can see why it would","",1
89,"be so easy to ignore the essence","",1
89,". In","",1
89,"this question and I'm sure I mean do you do","",1
89,". What ways do you see your experience","",1
89,"as one African-American minister. Them. Or the way you","",1
89,"treated me as when African-Americans line workers.","",1
89,"Right.","",1
89,"I'd say it is the same as a sighted person probably feels","",1
89,"how they're treated because definitely","",1
89,"if you why you get treated better","",1
89,". You know I'm sure that that's unfortunate but","",1
89,"again I don't think so much for myself because","",1
89,"my attitude is strong enough that I'm making myself","",1
89,"be a part of this I also find that","",1
89,"white people. Except blindness","",1
89,". A little loose.","",1
89,"No no. Because this is just this is just coming back to","",1
89,"go talk about this is it's like he the black person","",1
89,"throws a little more understanding to a black person period. But a","",1
89,"black person is like you know even if you're blind and that makes you","",1
89,"or are you just so good at what you do do you know","",1
89,"OK we don't care we don't know why are you doing","",1
89,"so. Isn't working for me or worse a lot worse and they want to take time","",1
89,"for me they might ask more questions. There might be a little more","",1
89,"patient. Excuse me ma'am.","",1
89,"Yes You know so what reason or patient with","",1
89,"people more than you know more patients but by the same","",1
89,"token the more patronage you know so you","",1
89,"know you get both of these.","",1
89,"Yes I want to help you because you know it's amazing how you do this","",1
89,"you know was the black one you know you got it right. Oh you know that you do","",1
89,"you know they know you want to be on here. Then you came this far you know to","",1
89,"keep right. You know so that's best to me is the","",1
89,"biggest difference you know.","",1
89,"So yeah I was","",1
89,"told that right.","",1
89,"Well I mean I still feel the same fears and I mean if I go like","",1
89,"I used to ski so I don't go up to and you know how","",1
89,"many black people ski and I know so most of our friends when we go you","",1
89,"know from the past week answer best friend","",1
89,"and he passed away five years ago. They have a lot of","",1
89,"you have sports and health and ski for right. These two","",1
89,"organizations are blind us A.B.A.","",1
89,"blind athletes. So there's stuff going on all over","",1
89,"the country with skiing skiing cross-country skiing these","",1
89,"forces provided the guy and the girl behind you and you go","",1
89,"cry before we bomb and I love it because inside it people paying the","",1
89,"same amount of their land in their eyes and you get paired up","",1
89,"before we start. Right right there you know someone","",1
89,"for that week and you know if I don't ski in my real life it's","",1
89,"got to be white ones and then you cannot","",1
89,"find a flag to take us to his bar","",1
89,"because now I'm going with Drake and we take us there because","",1
89,"one he knows that they're not going to. If I came in so they","",1
89,"maybe he knows people are going to us and","",1
89,"then they're going to do it because we're black and they accepted us","",1
89,"but they said it was we got us down because we","",1
89,"live so except the next year I can bring my","",1
89,"son. Because they really understand it would be black","",1
89,"people know they have a ball and so it works that way too. Then","",1
89,"I can get into neighborhoods you know I know times but","",1
89,". This isn't a documentary","",1
89,"on my website when I was three years old we took a bus to the jail","",1
89,"here we stopped it in the C","",1
89,"N N LIVE TODAY AND I HAD to go to the bathroom and the","",1
89,"guy said two. Years. And I","",1
89,"used to know you got to go around","",1
89,"on you to color people's bed.","",1
89,"And shoot some time and","",1
89,"he said you know a lot of trouble to go","",1
89,". So he let us go with Bentley","",1
89,"for two years I thought it was","",1
89,"fantastic and this is really because this is being","",1
89,"molded me. There's the line thing is special because the guy let","",1
89,"me go back and lie of course I don't pull a race and I","",1
89,"believe God has let me and be special because I live I mean","",1
89,"you know Life is Beautiful","",1
89,"Mind and you know so house I was so","",1
89,"proud that made me probably","",1
89,"said maybe one of the older you know you know","",1
89,"because. Some people","",1
89,"always ask me don't you want to see I mean I have all my life","",1
89,"that I wanted to see but I always used to say I wish they would come up with something that","",1
89,"could help me over this way and I didn't","",1
89,"want to be one I just want to get around faster read books","",1
89,"war given all of that stuff and","",1
89,"so. If","",1
89,"I could afford it and it happened I'd probably try","",1
89,"something you know. Yeah they said","",1
89,"yeah there's a possibility that you could lose your hearing. OK","",1
89,".","",1
89,"So. I mean because I like who I am so","",1
89,"I know what I got I don't know what it is.","",1
89,"Keep it here but if you told me that I was","",1
89,"so sure","",1
89,"but I really clicked with me more realistic","",1
89,"you know and how rich they are you know with five you know where that","",1
89,"American guy robot so that I can use the G.P.S.","",1
89,"used to walk around street to go places","",1
89,". Without fanfare. You know and then this way","",1
89,"cool. So I hope you know before I let you","",1
89,"know it in the car. Try to be ready to drive itself","",1
89,"so. You know","",1
89,"that their way is","",1
89,"that you don't have to walk on you know you know because it's","",1
89,"company the company is walking the streets","",1
89,"OK because I know that I can take this lightly and it takes a look at it","",1
89,"in a corner.","",1
89,"Well I don't know though. So if we can get a","",1
89,"robot down because they have everything they got the","",1
89,"shoes for shoes or you","",1
89,"can follow your your way on the scene. Do you","",1
89,"suppose people as you walk pending on. What","",1
89,"Your Stuff feed bridge. You know have these caves","",1
89,"like they have cameras you know that if you point to something in a read","",1
89,". Only thing about them is that visually because at least you can see where","",1
89,"scientists are.","",1
89,"Just amazing.","",1
89,"Oh well you know from you know like G.P.S.","",1
89,"the chest using G.P.S. Now","",1

89,"mission block and that's","",1
89,". Useful through college. Yes they","",1
89,"have people who you know get a job as the paper for equipment you know","",1
89,"and it's expensive. Well yeah","",1
89,"you know so you know all that by you know","",1
89,"but that's the beautiful thing about Apple. You used to have to spend","",1
89,"fifteen hundred dollars pushed by the computer for a grand then you noticed another","",1
89,"to get the screen readers Jaws you have violent stuff.","",1
89,"What Apple has done. It's open up the market","",1
89,"for all people because not everything that we","",1
89,"buy or do is it's what everyone else","",1
89,"is trying to mainstream with not knowing when to pay three thousand","",1
89,"dollars more just ahead. It's all in there and we're buying the same","",1
89,"phone using the same stuff and we're paying the same price","",1

89,"If so you know I love you so","",1
89,"you can do for me because I can't do it now.","",1

89,"you see one person. You know doing","",1
89,"some kind of skill or skill is not","",1
89,"as.","",1
89,"Good as it","",1
89,".","",1
89,"Was that it was","",1
89,"you know in my lifetime.","",1
89,"It's a run to the right person that that will be","",1
89,"able to give the expose and to","",1
89,"your singing. So it was such a tough business to start with","",1
89,". Well it's a tough business but you know I mean I made it tough because a lot of that","",1
89,"is is on me. I'm a perfectionist so I","",1
89,"finally went back to being sixty eight got me to","",1
89,"this point we're not seeing you because I wanted to be a star when it was","",1
89,"thirty years ago I was saying because I thought I was going to be some and not say now because I actually","",1
89,"just got the passion for the love and love and. The","",1
89,"sharing that stuff with other people out there.","",1
89,"Musicians singers and I actually just enjoy","",1
89,"the feelings. I mean you know so chastened the","",1
89,"rainbow anymore but still a long ride before you joined the","",1
89,"road. Do you know what to do you know a bunch of people who are also singers or","",1
89,"musicians blind or say either oh yeah oh","",1
89,"yeah. Well that's and that's that's where Facebook is due to","",1
89,"be a lively community. I always go to people saying","",1
89,"you know what I assume you know people who are","",1
89,"supporting me.","",1
89,"So it's really you know they're working well. But really","",1
89,"you know I mean if you don't have the talent pool","",1
89,"you don't have the right sound. Why don't you have that you know you go to","",1
89,"south first and I'll follow you to the point where I said","",1
89,"you know so I was in transition and that's enough","",1
89,"for ten fifteen years I really just went through the motions but I","",1
89,"didn't realize it was gone.","",1
89,"So I'm just saying you know we were here I think","",1
89,"it was very it was eighty six. So OK so you're you're","",1
89,"fifty three through three here","",1
89,"but I don't you know we were and I was","",1
89,"you know is to create is a gift and","",1
89,"bless them you know had a great family. With","",1
89,"my daughter and wife grandson that's really the base of my","",1
89,"family my brother's abusive but his his","",1
89,"his daughter lives here with friends so you know","",1
89,"but all of our friends families close friends by","",1
89,"all of us by a guy like friends are","",1
89,"old it really is the last ten years and it was about","",1
89,"so you know you know. Around with every day life style","",1
89,"so one point or another you know that it took me a couple","",1
89,"years to get used to it affected. Well you know I have friends on the outside","",1
89,"cited for it blind you know which especially","",1
89,"a couple years ago.","",1
89,"Everywhere we go you know using a rifle three or four women who","",1
89,"are you know by close friends as well. Blind but","",1
89,"it's once and you know it but it took me a couple years and now I used to","",1
89,"be in those now.","",1
89,"Used all of the phone in some of the eight foot long","",1
89,"so I was there.","",1
89,"But you know it's also mean to not","",1
89,"for security force me to go out to have to be","",1
89,"more social and trusting outside with Sandra and","",1
89,"so it's and yes","",1
89,"the people","",1
89,"of acting alone to form a sentence.","",1
89,"It's you know that that's the stuff that's tangible","",1
89,"physical stuff that I can feel I can I can move off","",1
89,"or grow from Turkey on fire and I love","",1
89,"you know I love that feeling. But again it's all of that stuff","",1
89,"to me still doesn't make up the power of vision","",1
89,"and if you use the beautiful way like I was thinking if I have my present","",1
89,"with this site nature I'm the author chose right. I","",1
89,"don't know I was home because","",1
89,"the site is it's to me it's","",1
89,"almost as powerful as music.","",1
89,"But. But I love the challenge of.","",1
89,"Letting people know that it's OK It's OK.","",1
89,"You don't want people to be scared of life because","",1
89,"it was so afraid of losing that state power","",1
89,"that they're afraid of black people might run off on","",1
89,"this and it really just makes them think about the line you know I want to","",1
89,"think about it and then the other thing is","",1
89,"you know you know that the telling people who are with me","",1
89,"and we hang out. And people do stuff","",1
89,"that is like over here oh over the years you know","",1
89,"that's the biggest compliment of world because they you know","",1
89,"that I am you know you know my own head.","",1
89,"So it's really","",1
89,"you know you're a presence in didn't even know that","",1
89,"you just live here","",1
89,"and that it can be done you know you can do it and you do it","",1
89,"with the assistance of say you know I'm going to","",1
89,"do so he goes in","",1
89,"there for him it sounds like you've been lucky in","",1
89,"many ways. That people you will","",1
89,"and your spirit is so wonderful. Well you know to bring you know that you","",1
89,"brought a close friend and support and people loved you clearly in you know including you know","",1
89,"childhood buddies as well as what color. Yeah yeah yeah.","",1
89,"That's really you know again it's all over folks and what","",1
89,". They they they they they lay the foundation.","",1
89,"They showed me how to do it and that's","",1
89,"going to do that","",1
89,"you know all today all","",1
89,"gave me a chance. Or to be","",1
89,"with me you know","",1
89,"when your kids are saying not saying they didn't they","",1
89,"didn't work they do not feel sorry for me because of the Black Berry","",1
89,"where you get what you deserve.","",1
89,"But a major problem is that use the car let us out so I can feel","",1
89,"used to find little toys that he knew I will","",1
89,"be able to feel or hear but I don't want to tell them to","",1
89,"do their base ball game you know they used to have had","",1
89,"square holes in it or out of the round","",1
89,"of these holes in the outfield inordinately I mean we really find this you","",1
89,"know to me that's amazing stuff because you know so that stuff in any blind","",1
89,"school or even your ways world are something that I can","",1
89,"relate.","",1
89,"To you. Know so.","",1
89,"Figures like little soldiers. Anything that I can","",1
89,"touch you know and I just looked at","",1
89,"me and I could see it was if he was in a life could be that he hung around my","",1
89,"school or life friends I could see all of that but it is","",1
89,"too didn't you","",1
89,"write a kid sized to do it right when you need it relate to","",1

143,"that you see different possibilities depending","",1

143,"And I guess. I want to know if you have any idea","",1

143,"the forces are might determine","",1
143,"that one","",1
143,"one zero zero zero zero another team that","",1
143,"the in post part. I will say","",1
143,"that","",1
143,"this. This area. As a bright future could be beautiful it could","",1

143,"The possibilities are in this.","",1
143,"I mean it's already natural beauty when beautiful we have such a great resource here.","",1
143,"That should be admired and destroyed.","",1
143,"It should be a","",1
143,"place that neighborhood. Not just you know just being on my.","",1

143,"the neighborhood. Can always","",1
143,"retain its intimacy and beauty.","",1
143,"Only if there's a collective push to do","",1
